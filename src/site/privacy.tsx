				This Privacy Policy explains how Better Giving, Inc. ("we", "us")
				handles personal data in the Better Giving Connector (the "Connector"),
				available at https://app.connect.better.giving. The Connector lets a
				nonprofit manage its Better Giving account from your AI assistant. You
				sign in at better.giving, or you connect your own Better Giving site's
				address.
			</p>

			<h2>1. Who we are and how to contact us</h2>
			<p>
				Better Giving, Inc., 18 Cottekill Rd, Rosendale, NY 12472. Contact:
				support@better.giving.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Our role.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					For the operator's account and connection data (Section 2.1), we are
					the <strong>controller</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					For data about a nonprofit's donors, supporters and campaigns that
					passes through the Connector (Section 2.2), the{" "}
					<strong>nonprofit operator is the controller</strong> and we act only
					as its <strong>processor / service provider</strong>, processing it
					solely on the operator's instructions to carry out the requested
					action. Donors who want to exercise rights over their data should
					contact the nonprofit that holds it.
				</li>

			<h3>2.2 Data relayed to your site</h3>
			<p>
				When you ask your AI assistant to do something, tool requests and
				results (for example campaigns, forms, donation records, and donor
				names, email addresses and donation amounts) travel between your AI
				assistant and <strong>your Better Giving account</strong>. The Connector
				relays this data to complete the request. Tool requests and results are
				held in memory only while a request runs. They are not written to our
				database or logs.
			</p>

			<h3>2.3 Logs</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Application logs:</strong> the tool name, the outcome, and how
					long the call took; the connect step and its outcome; how many
					connections a sweep removed and how long that took; and, for an error,
					where it happened and the error's name. They do not include tool
					arguments, tool results, tokens, or keys.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Hosting request logs:</strong> Our hosting provider keeps
					request logs, including the request path, the approximate region from
					your IP address, and your browser or client type.
				</li>
				<li>
					Logs are kept for a limited period set by our hosting provider, then
					deleted. We don't send these logs to any other service.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2.4 What we do not collect</h3>
			<p>
				We do not collect payment card data, and the Connector does not move
				money. We do not knowingly collect government identifiers or health
				information. We do not read your chat history; we only receive what your
				AI assistant sends to a tool.
			</p>

			<h2>3. Why we use it (purposes)</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>To authenticate you and keep you signed in.</li>
				<li>
					To relay your requests to your Better Giving site and return the
					results.
				</li>
				<li>To detect abuse and diagnose errors (logs).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share personal data for advertising,
				we do not use it for profiling or automated decisions with legal or
				similar effects, and we do not use it to train AI models.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not sell personal information, and we do not share it for
				cross-context behavioral advertising, as those terms are used in the
				California Consumer Privacy Act.
			</p>
			<p>
				California residents may request to know, delete, or correct personal
				information and will not be discriminated against for exercising these
				rights. Contact support@better.giving.
			</p>

			</div>
			<p>
				Your Better Giving site receives the connection key with each request.
				It also receives tool requests, and disconnect and revoke calls.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we act as processor for a nonprofit (Section 2.2), Vercel Inc. is
				our sub-processor for hosting; that data is held in memory only while a
				request runs. Nonprofits can request our data processing agreement and
				current sub-processor list at support@better.giving.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not use analytics or telemetry. The Connector's code is{" "}
				<a href="https://github.com/better-giving/better-giving-connector">
					open source
				</a>
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may also disclose data where required by law or to protect rights and
				safety, and to a successor in a merger or acquisition, subject to this
				policy.
			</p>

			<h2>5. How long we keep it (retention)</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Connection key:</strong> the Connector stores its own
					encrypted copy of each connection key. It deletes that copy when you
					disconnect, when your AI assistant revokes the refresh token, when the
					refresh token expires, or when the session ends. It asks your site to
					revoke the key, and still deletes its copy if that request fails.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Better Giving Standalone site you connect to revokes a connection
					key after 90 days without use, and deletes revoked keys 30 days later.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Access and refresh tokens</strong> are stored as one-way
					(SHA-256) hashes, not the tokens themselves. To handle a retried
					refresh, the latest token response is also kept encrypted. It can be
					used only for {REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_INTERVAL} seconds, and the daily
					sweep deletes it within a day after that. A refresh token expires
					after {lifetimeLabel(REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN)} without use. An
					assistant that keeps refreshing receives a new token and the{" "}
					{lifetimeLabel(REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN)} start again. An access token
					expires after {lifetimeLabel(ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN)}.
				</li>
				<li>
					A server-side session record for each connection, with no IP address
					or browser details. The session token is stored as the token itself. A
					session lasts up to {lifetimeLabel(SESSION_EXPIRES_IN)}. When the year
					ends, the connection ends even if a refresh token has time left.
				</li>
				<li>
					OAuth client registrations store a client ID, a name, redirect URLs,
					optional contacts, a logo, policy URLs, and metadata supplied by the
					app developer, and an encrypted client secret. Contacts may include
					the developer's email. They are kept while the app remains registered;
					contact us to have one removed.
				</li>
				<li>
					A consent record of which app was authorized, and which scopes, is
					deleted with the connection.
				</li>
				<li>
					Authorization codes are single-use, stored as one-way (SHA-256)
					hashes, not the codes themselves, and expire within minutes. The row
					holds the authorization request details, not the code, until the code
					is used or it expires.
				</li>
				<li>
					A rate-limit counter whose key is the client IP address and the
					endpoint. An IPv6 address is stored as its /64. When a client IP
					address is not available, that endpoint has one shared counter. A
					counter is deleted when its last request is more than{" "}
					{lifetimeLabel(RATE_LIMIT_RETENTION)} old.
				</li>
				<li>
					A sign-in that is not finished is deleted by the daily sweep once it
					is more than 1 hour old.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Logs:</strong> logs are kept for a limited period set by our
					hosting provider, then deleted. We don't send these logs to any other
					service.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>6. Your controls and rights</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Disconnect</strong> the Connector in your AI assistant, or
					revoke its refresh token. This deletes the encrypted connection key
					and the OAuth tokens stored here, and asks that account to revoke the
					key.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Read-only access</strong>: an AI assistant can ask for
					read-only access. A read-only connection can view your Better Giving
					site but not change anything.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Request deletion or access</strong> by emailing
					support@better.giving. We respond within 30 days (or as required by
					law).
				</li>
				<li>
					If we receive a request about donor data, we will forward it to the
					relevant nonprofit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct,
					delete, or port your data, object to or restrict processing, and
					complain to your local data protection authority.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>7. Security</h2>
			<p>
				Connection keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM, under a key held
				in our hosting provider's production environment, separate from the
				database. Traffic uses HTTPS. Logs do not include keys or request
				content. No system is perfectly secure. Report vulnerabilities to
				security@better.giving.
			</p>

			<h2>8. International transfers</h2>
			<p>
				We process data in the United States. Where EU or UK law requires it, we
				rely on the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses and the
				UK Addendum.
			</p>

			<h2>9. GDPR</h2>
			<p>
				If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you can
				ask for access to, correction of, or deletion of the operator account
				and connection data we store, and you can object to or ask us to
				restrict that processing, or ask for a copy of it. Email
				support@better.giving. You can also complain to your local data
				protection authority. We process that account and connection data to
				provide the Connector (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)) and we process security
				logs to protect the service (Article 6(1)(f)). Donor data that passes
				through the Connector is controlled by the nonprofit.
			</p>

			<h2>10. Children</h2>
			<p>
				The Connector is for nonprofit operators who are at least 18. It is not
				directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect their data.
			</p>

			<h2>11. Changes</h2>
			<p>
				We will post updates on this page and change the "Last updated" date.
				For material changes, we will post a notice on this page and, where we
				have a contact address for your organization through your Better Giving
				account, notify that address, at least 30 days before the change takes
				effect. Earlier versions are listed in the{" "}
				<a href="#changelog">changelog</a> below.
